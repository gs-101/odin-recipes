============

***First project of The Odin Project***

# Summary

This is the first project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), used to test one's knowledge of the foundations so far.

# Palette

The color palette for this project is currently based on the "Mocha" variant of the [Catppuccin](https://catppuccin.com/) color paletter, a well-known color palette featuring pastel colours.

Mocha is the darkest variant provided.

# Recipes

## Pão de Queijo
[^2]

Cheese bread that apparently exists in other places in Latin America, not only Brazil. Gets kinda boring if you eat too much of it, but if you fill it with cream cheese it's perfect.

## Miso Soup
[^4]

Traditional japanese soup, composed of miso paste (japanese seasoning produced by fermenting beans or grains) and other ingredients.

## Caesar Salad
[^5]

Green salad of romaine lettuce and croutons dressed with lemon juice, olive oil, eggs, Worcestershire sauce, anchovies, garlic, Dijon mustard, Parmesan and black pepper.
