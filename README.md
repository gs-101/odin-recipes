# Skills

By the end of this project, I'll have demonstrated that I can use:

1. [Git](https://git-scm.com).
2. [GitHub](https://github.com).
3. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)[^1].
4. [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org).

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)/[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) is not included here because I prefer [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs).

## Additional Skills

The other files present here demonstrate that I can also use:

1. [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org).
2. [Nix](https://nixos.org) and its experimental [Flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes).
3. [Direnv](https://direnv.net).
4. [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org).
5. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) (to manage the references).
