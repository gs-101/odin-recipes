    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pão de queijo is a gluten and wheat-free cheese bread.</p>
    <p>The name is in portuguese because it is thought to be the
    characteristic dish of the brazilian state of Minas Gerais - but,
    apparently, it is also present in other Latin American cuisines.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>1&frasl;3 cup of water</li>
      <li>1&frasl;2 cup of olive oil or butter</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 cups of tapioca flour</li>
      <li>2 beaten eggs</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Set aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir cheese and eggs into the tapioca mixture until combined.

      <li>Drop dough by 1&frasl;4 cup-size balls onto an ungreased baking
      sheet.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned.
